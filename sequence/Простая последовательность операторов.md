Самостоятельная работа нужно взять англоязычный стих и написать программу которая будет печатать какой-нибудь сонет строчка за строчкой каждый раз когда нажимаю Enter

```Pascal
program sequence;

begin
        write('Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,');
        readln;
        write('And sorry I could not travel both');
        readln;
        write('And be one traveler, long I stood');
        readln;
        write('And looked down one as far as I could');
        readln;
        writeln('To where it bent in the undergrowth.');
        readln;
        write('Then took the other, as just as fair,');
        readln;
        write('And having perhaps the better claim,');
        readln;
        write('Because it was grassy and wanted wear;');
        readln;
        write('Though as for that the passing there;');
        readln;
        writeln('Had worn them really about the same.');
        readln;
        writeln('........');
end.
